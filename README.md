# Chat App
Welcome to the Chat App project! This application allows users to engage in real-time chatting, create accounts, log in, and interact with other online users. It utilizes a variety of technologies including JavaScript, Node.js, Express framework, MongoDB, Socket.io, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Mongoose, JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing.

## Features
- **Real-Time Chatting**: Users can engage in real-time conversations with other online users.
- **Account Creation**: Users can create accounts to access the chat functionality.
- **User Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for user authentication.
- **Password Security**: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being saved in the database.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: The primary language used for both server-side and client-side development.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side of the application.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, utilized for building the RESTful API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data and chat messages.
- **Socket.io**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the UI components.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to simplify interactions with the MongoDB database.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, used for user authentication.
- **bcrypt**: A library used for password hashing to enhance security.
